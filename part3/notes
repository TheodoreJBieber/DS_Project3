Part 2:

The commands I used to put files onto the hadoop fs were:

sudo hadoop fs -put customers.txt /home/hadoop/input
sudo hadoop fs -put transactions.txt /home/hadoop/input

to double check that they were there, i copied them back onto my desktop

sudo hadoop fs -copyToLocal /home/hadoop/input /home/hadoop/Desktop/

and the files showed up on my desktop, so I knew it worked.

compiling a query:

javac -classpath /usr/share/hadoop/hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar -d classes_directory_name ./JavaFileName.java
jar -cvf ./JavaFileName.jar -C classes_directory_name/ .

running the job:

sudo hadoop jar ./JavaFileName.jar MainClassName <input file path> <new output file path>
